"""
This module provides functionality for seeding your database with initial data.
It is intended to be used as a starting point for adding seed data
to your database.

## Example Usage

```python
# Import your models
from your_app.models import Model

def seed_database():
    # Create an instance of the model with the desired data
    model = Model(name="Example Name")

    # Save the model instance to the database
    model.save()
```

If you have multiple seed file or prefer a structured approach, consider 
creating a `db/seeds/` directory to organize your seeding scripts. 
You can then import and execute these modules within this script as needed.

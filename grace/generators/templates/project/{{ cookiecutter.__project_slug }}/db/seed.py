"""
This module provides functionality for seeding your database with initial data.
It is intended to be used as a starting point for adding seed data
to your database.

## Example Usage

```python
# Import your models
from your_app.models import Model

def seed_database():
    # Create an instance of the model with the desired data
    model = Model(name="Example Name")

    # Save the model instance to the database
    model.save()
```

If you have many seeds or want a more structured approach to seeding,
it is recommended to create a `db/seeds/` directory and organize your seeding
scripts within that folder. You can then import your seeding modules into
this script and call them as needed.

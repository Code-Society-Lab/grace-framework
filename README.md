## What is Grace Framework
Grace Framework is an opinionated, extensible Discord bot framework built on top of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). It comes with a various tools designed to help you rapidly build scalable, feature-rich Discord bots with minimal boilerplate.

#### Key features
- **Quick to start**: Generate a full-featured bot in seconds
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of features via extensions
- **Database Integration**: Easily connect your bot to a persistent backend
- **Built-in Generators**: Create extensions, models and more with a single command

#### Inspiration
Grace Framework was inspired by the evolution of our community discord bot, [Grace](https://github.com/Code-Society-Lab/grace),  that evolved, gaining support for modular extensions, database integrations, and rapid feature development — it began to resemble a standalone framework. Recognizing its potential, we decided to extracted its architecture into Grace Framework, making its ease-of-use and flexibility available to developers everywhere.

# Grace Framework
Opinionated extensible Discord bot framework built on top of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

### Key features
- **Modular Architecture**
- **Database Integration**
- **Built-in Generators**

### Inspiration
Inspired by our Discord bot [Grace](https://github.com/Code-Society-Lab/grace), which was initially designed for our community, we noticed its evolution into an exceptionally user-friendly platform. Grace facilitated the seamless addition of new features, extensions, and database integrations, to the point that it almost functioned as its own framework. Recognizing its potential, we decided to extract these architectural principles into a dedicated framework, enabling others to benefit from the ease and efficiency that we built into Grace.

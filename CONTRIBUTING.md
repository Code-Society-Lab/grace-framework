# Contributing to Grace Framework
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Grace Framework! As an open source project, many kinds of contributions are welcome.

## How can you contribute?
You can contribute to this project in the follwing ways

- Report Bugs
- Add new features
- Fix a bug
- Improve the documentation

**Warning:** Non-trivial pull requests must have an [issue](https://github.com/Code-Society-Lab/grace-framework/issues) proposing the changes.

## Setup
1. Clone the Textual repository
2. Create a virtual enviroment
3. Install the dependencies

## Guidelines
Read any issue instructions carefully. Feel free to ask for clarification if any details are missing.

Add docstrings to all of your code (functions, methods, classes, ...). The codebase should have enough examples for you to copy from.

Write tests for your code.
    If you are fixing a bug, make sure to add regression tests that link to the original issue.
    If you are implementing new features, make sure to add tests

## Before opening a PR

Before you open your PR, please go through this checklist and make sure you've checked all the items that apply:

- [ ] Format your code, ensure that your code is clean and follows Python's [PEP-0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [ ] All your code has docstrings in the style of the rest of the codebase
- [ ] All your code is typed ([type hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html))
- [ ] Your code passes all tests (run [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/))
- [ ] Verify your code for grammar and spelling mistakes (The code, documentation and other text must be in English)


## After opening a PR
When you open a PR, your code will be reviewed by one of the Grace Framework maintainers. In that review process,

- We will take a look at all of the changes you are making
- We might ask for clarifications (why did you do X or Y?)
- We might ask for more tests/more documentation
- We might ask for some code changes

The primary goal of these interactions is to ensure that, over time, everyone enjoys the best possible experience with Grace Framework and the feature you're implementing or fixing.

Don't be discouraged if a reviewer requests code changesâ€”this is a normal part of the process. Even within the team, maintainers frequently request revisions from each other
